.SH DESCRIPTION
.B armada
is an __xservername__ driver for Marvell Armada SoCs.  This is an accelerated
driver, the following framebuffer depths are supported: 8, 15, 16, 24.
All visual types are supported for depth 8, and TrueColor visual is
supported for the other depths.  The driver has preliminary support for
the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Multi-head configurations are
supported.
.PP
Support for video overlay is provided, supporting I420, YV12, I422, YUY2,
UYVY, VYUY and YV16 formats.  The common I420 and YV12 formats are
converted on the fly by this driver to I422 and YV16 for the hardware.
Support is also provided for video overlay using an XVBO format, which
can be used to pass a drm buffer handle to the video overlay backend, as
well as Marvell's special
.B libbmm
based method.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The 
.B armada
driver currently supports the Marvell Armada 510 LCD controller(s).
.PP
.B armada
communicates with the Linux Kernel Direct Rendering Manager (drm) layer
to control and arbitrate access to the hardware.  Kernel drm support is
required.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to __xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to
this driver.
.PP
For this driver it is not required to specify modes in the screen 
section of the config file.  The
.B armada
driver will request video mode information from the Linux Kernel drm layer.
.PP
The VideoRAM option is ignored by this driver; video memory is managed
by the Linux Kernel drm layer using system memory.
